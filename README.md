**INTELLIGENT PAYMENT ROUTING SYSTEM**

● Built a full-stack web application using React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, allowing users to determine the most cost-effective and
  fastest payment routes between banks.
● Implemented Dijkstra’s algorithm to compute optimal routes based on transaction costs and transfer times, dynamically processing bank data
  stored in CSV files.
● Designed a secure user authentication with JWT & Bcrypt, and developed RESTful APIs to efficiently fetch and display real-time routing
  decisions on a sign up, sign in, and home page UI.
