/*
SOME BASIC KNOWLEDGE OF REDUX WITH REACT 

In a regular React app:
    ‚Ä¢   You store data in component state (useState).
    ‚Ä¢   You pass it down using props.
    ‚Ä¢   But if a component deep in the tree needs that state, you have to drill props through many layers (called prop drilling).
    ‚Ä¢   Also, it‚Äôs hard to share data between unrelated components (like Login and Navbar).

With Redux:
    ‚Ä¢   You create a central store (like a brain üß† for your app).
    ‚Ä¢   Any component can read or update data from this store directly using useSelector() and useDispatch().
    ‚Ä¢   Redux makes your state:
    ‚Ä¢   Global (accessible anywhere)
    ‚Ä¢   Centralized (easier to manage/debug)
    ‚Ä¢   Predictable (only reducers change the state)
  
High level Architecture with Redux : 
[Component (UI)]
      ‚Üì dispatch(action)
[Thunk (optional async logic)]
      ‚Üì
[Reducer (pure function)]
      ‚Üì
[Store (global state)]
      ‚Üë
useSelector() pulls data back into components


store.js : Creates the global state store and connects all slices (auth, etc.)
authSlice.js : Holds the actual data (user, token) and logic (login/signup/logout)
authAPI.js : Contains fetch calls to your backend (/api/signup, /api/login)
createAsyncThunk : Automates async actions √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù handles loading/error/success in one go
Provider : Wraps your <App /> to give it access to the store
